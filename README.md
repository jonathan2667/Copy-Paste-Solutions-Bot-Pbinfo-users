# Problem Copy-Bot ü§ñ

## Introduction
Problem Copy-Bot is a sophisticated Python script engineered to streamline the process of copying problems from one platform to another. Leveraging Selenium, this bot automates the task of copying problem descriptions from "www.pbinfo.ro" and submitting them to the same platform with minimal human intervention.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Problem Copying:** Automates the process of copying problems from one website to another seamlessly.
- **Dual-Browser Operation:** Utilizes both Chrome and Firefox web browsers for parallel processing.
- **Smart Handling:** Detects and handles discrepancies between platforms gracefully.
- **Minimal Human Intervention:** Runs autonomously, requiring minimal manual oversight.

## How it Works
1. The bot logs in to "www.pbinfo.ro" using predefined credentials for both Chrome and Firefox browsers.
2. It iterates through a range of problems, copying the description from one browser and submitting it using the other.
3. The bot intelligently handles any discrepancies or errors encountered during the copying process.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Selenium
- WebDriver (for Chrome and Firefox)

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of additional error handling mechanisms for improved robustness.
- Implementation of advanced logging and reporting features.
- Optimization for performance and reliability.

## Note
While functional, the bot may require periodic updates to maintain compatibility with website changes.
